A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. Itâ€™s a function that takes a component as input and returns a new component with enhanced behavior or additional props.

Key Concepts of HOCs:
Function-based: HOCs are functions that wrap another component and return a new component.

Enhances Components: HOCs allow you to add additional functionality or modify existing behavior without altering the original component directly.

Composition: HOCs are often used to compose logic across multiple components, promoting reusability.
